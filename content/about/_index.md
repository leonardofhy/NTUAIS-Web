## Our Story

National Taiwan University AI Safety (NTUAIS) began in 2024 when a group of students and researchers recognized the urgent need for AI safety education and community in Taiwan. What started as informal reading groups has grown into a thriving community of learners, researchers, and practitioners dedicated to ensuring AI remains safe and beneficial.

Now in our third year (2026), we've expanded to offer structured fellowships, technical reading groups, and workshops that bring together students, professionals, and curious minds from all backgrounds. Our programs have fostered a new generation of AI safety thinkers in Taiwan, creating connections both locally and with the global AI safety community.

We're committed to building a sustainable ecosystem where rigorous research, accessible education, and global collaboration converge to tackle one of humanity's most important challenges.
