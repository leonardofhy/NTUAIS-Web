# Development Log - 2026-01-31

## Summary

Initial setup, repository exploration, and migration to a modern tech community theme (Blowfish).

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Analyzed repository structure (Hugo-based static site)
- [x] Fixed incorrect README.md (was showing Astro template instead of Hugo)
- [x] Added macOS and Linux installation instructions
- [x] Installed Hugo via Homebrew
- [x] Started local development server successfully
- [x] Created `docs/` and `devlogs/` directories
- [x] Renamed organization from TWAIS to NTUAIS
- [x] Drafted a "Tech Community Website Development Guide" in `docs/`
- [x] **Theme Migration**: Successfully migrated to the **Blowfish** theme (installed as git submodule)
- [x] **Config Refactor**: Moved site configuration to the standard `config/_default/` modular structure
- [x] **Member Staff Feature**: Created `data/authors/` directory and an example JSON template for team profiles

## Technical Notes

- **Framework**: Hugo (static site generator)
- **Theme**: [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) (Git Submodule at `themes/blowfish`)
- **Backup**: Original `ntuais` theme backed up to `themes/ntuais.backup/`
- **Config**: Modular TOML files in `config/_default/`
- **Authors**: Data-driven profiles in `data/authors/*.json`

## Next Steps

- [ ] Populating real member profiles in `data/authors/`
- [ ] Adding a custom logo to `static/img/ntuais-logo.png`
- [ ] Fine-tuning Blowfish color schemes and features in `params.toml`
- [ ] Implementing the "Resource Library" or "Sponsors Wall" as planned in the roadmap

## AI Collaboration Notes

This session was highly productive with AI assistance focusing on:

- Environment setup and repository fixing
- Global rename (TWAIS -> NTUAIS)
- Architecture transition (Custom theme -> Feature-rich Blowfish theme)
- Documentation of future development roadmap
